## Life of A Packet

* Each interface in a routing device has a MAC address.

* Every switch also has a MAC address.

* When the destination IP address is out if the network the device automatically send the packet to the router thats connected to that network.

* in the IPv4 header the source comes first but in the frame header destination comes first.
