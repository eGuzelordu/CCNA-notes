## VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Masks)

* Until now, we have practiced subnetting used FLSM(Fixed length Subnet Masks)

* This means that all of the subnets use the same prefix length

* VLSM is the process of creating subnets of diffrent sizes, to make your use of network addresses more efficent.

* VLSM is more complicated than FLSM, but it's easy if you follow the steps correctly.

#### Steps For VLSM

1) Assign the largest subnet at the start of the address space.

2) Assign the second-largest subnet after it.

3) Repeat the process until all subnets have been assigned.
